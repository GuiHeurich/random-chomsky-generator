# RandomChomskyGenerator

Have you ever woken up to the feeling 'I need to read a meaningless random sentence inspired by Noam Chomsky's book *Syntactic Structures* RIGHT NOW!'

Well, of course not. BUT NOW YOU CAN! :)

### System

Developed in Ruby using Sinatra and Capybara.
Test-driven all the way through.

### Objective

Practice what I have learned during the first three weeks of my bootcamp at Makers Academy â€“ which included dependency injection in Ruby, TDD, and web testing frameworks.

### I'll be happy if I...

...have a thin controller and a model that has neatly differentiated classes, each with methods that respect SRP and are no more than 5 lines long.

### By?
